# Connecting with Microsoft Graph using OpenID Connect

This demo will walk you through creating a web application that connects with Microsoft Graph using OpenID Connect.

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2017
- A personal Microsoft Account with access to an Outlook.com enabled mailbox
- A work or school account with access to an Office 365 enabled mailbox

## Register the application

1. Visit the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) to register the application.

1. Once the application is created, an app ID is provided on the screen. Copy this app ID, you will use it as the Client ID.

1. Add a new app secret by selecting the **Generate new password** button and copy the app secret to use later as the client secret.

1. Select the **Add Platform** button. A dialog box is presented, choose **Web Application**.

1. Change the Redirect URL to **https://localhost:44326/** and select **Save** to save all changes.

    ![Screenshot of properties information showing app ID and app secret in Application Registration Portal.](../../Images/11.png)

1. From your shell or command line, paste the following:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-v2.git
    ```

1. Open the solution using **Visual Studio 2017**. Restore the missing NuGet packages and reload the solution.

1. Edit the **web.config** file with your app's coordinates. Find the appSettings key `ida:ClientId` and provide the app ID from your app registration. Find the appSettings key `ida:ClientSecret` and provide the value from the app secret generated in the previous step.

## Inspect the code sample

1. Open the **App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs** file. This is where authentication begins using the OWIN middleware.

1. Verify that the `Scope` variable in your code is equal to `openid email profile offline_access Mail.Read`. Change it if needed.

    ```csharp
    app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
        new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
        {
            // The `Authority` represents the v2.0 endpoint - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0
            // The `Scope` describes the initial permissions that your app will need.  See https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-scopes/

            ClientId = clientId,
            Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, "common", "/v2.0"),
            RedirectUri = redirectUri,
            Scope = "openid email profile offline_access Mail.Read",
            PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
            TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
            {
                ValidateIssuer = false,
                // In a real application you would use IssuerValidator for additional checks, like making sure the user's organization has signed up for your app.
                //     IssuerValidator = (issuer, token, tvp) =>
                //     {
                //        //if(MyCustomTenantValidation(issuer))
                //        return issuer;
                //        //else
                //        //    throw new SecurityTokenInvalidIssuerException("Invalid issuer");
                //    },
            },
    ```

    >Note:  When an authorization code is received, the code is redeemed for an access token and a refresh token which are stored in cache.

    ```csharp
    Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
    {
        // If there is a code in the OpenID Connect response, redeem it for an access token and refresh token, and store those away.
        AuthorizationCodeReceived = async (context) =>
        {
            var code = context.Code;
            string signedInUserID = context.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
            TokenCache userTokenCache = new MSALSessionCache(signedInUserID,
                context.OwinContext.Environment["System.Web.HttpContextBase"] as HttpContextBase).GetMsalCacheInstance();
            ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
                new ConfidentialClientApplication(clientId, redirectUri, new ClientCredential(appKey), userTokenCache,null);
            string[] scopes = { "Mail.Read" };
            try
            {
                AuthenticationResult result = await cca.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync(code, scopes);
            }
            catch (Exception eee)
            {

            }
        },
        AuthenticationFailed = (notification) =>
        {
            notification.HandleResponse();
            notification.Response.Redirect("/Error?message=" + notification.Exception.Message);
            return Task.FromResult(0);
        }
    }
    ```

1. Open the **Models/MsalSessionCache.cs** file. Notice that the token is persisted in session state. In case of a load-balanced application, such as an Azure Web App with multiple instances, you may need to centrally persist the state to avoid forcing the user to log on multiple times.

    ```csharp
    public void Load()
    {
        SessionLock.EnterReadLock();
        cache.Deserialize((byte[])httpContext.Session[CacheId]);
        SessionLock.ExitReadLock();
    }

    public void Persist()
    {
        SessionLock.EnterWriteLock();

        // Optimistically set HasStateChanged to false. We need to do it early to avoid losing changes made by a concurrent thread.
        cache.HasStateChanged = false;

        // Reflect changes in the persistent store
        httpContext.Session[CacheId] = cache.Serialize();
        SessionLock.ExitWriteLock();
    }
    ```

1. Open the **Controllers/HomeController.cs** file and view the **About** controller method. The **Authorize** attribute ensures that only authenticated users can exercise this code. The **About** method contains code to retrieve the current user's claims and makes them available via the `ViewBag` for display by the view. The Azure AD v2.0 endpoint returns an `id_token` back to the application which contains these claims. The data backing these claims is present because the **OpenID Connect** scopes **openid** and **profile** were requested.

    ```csharp
    [Authorize]
    public async Task<ActionResult> About()
    {
        ViewBag.Name = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("name").Value;
        ViewBag.AuthorizationRequest = string.Empty;
        // The object ID claim will only be emitted for work or school accounts at this time.
        Claim oid = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/objectidentifier");
        ViewBag.ObjectId = oid == null ? string.Empty : oid.Value;

        // The 'preferred_username' claim can be used for showing the user's primary way of identifying themselves
        ViewBag.Username = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("preferred_username").Value;

        // The subject or nameidentifier claim can be used to uniquely identify the user
        ViewBag.Subject = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier").Value;
        return View();
    }
    ```

1. Open the **Controllers/HomeController.cs** file and view the **ReadMail** controller method. Unlike the **About** method, this method is not decorated with the `Authorize` attribute. The method retrieves the current user's token cache and creates a new `ConfidentialClientApplication` using the user's token cache. If there are users in the cache, the code calls `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` which will look in the cache for a token matching the user and the requested scope. If one is not present, it will attempt to use the refresh token. It then attaches the token to the request to Microsoft Graph to retrieve the user's messages.

    ```csharp
    public async Task<ActionResult> ReadMail()
    {
        try
        {
            string signedInUserID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
            TokenCache userTokenCache = new MSALSessionCache(signedInUserID, this.HttpContext).GetMsalCacheInstance();

            ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
                new ConfidentialClientApplication(clientId, redirectUri, new ClientCredential(appKey), userTokenCache, null);
            if (cca.Users.Count() > 0)
            {
                string[] scopes = { "Mail.Read" };
                AuthenticationResult result = await cca.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(scopes, cca.Users.First());

                HttpClient hc = new HttpClient();
                hc.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
                    new System.Net.Http.Headers.AuthenticationHeaderValue("bearer", result.AccessToken);
                HttpResponseMessage hrm = await hc.GetAsync("https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages");
                string rez = await hrm.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
                ViewBag.Message = rez;
            }
            else { }
            return View();
        }
        catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
        {
            ViewBag.Relogin = "true";
            return View();
        }
        catch (Exception eee)
        {
            ViewBag.Error = "An error has occurred. Details: " + eee.Message;
            return View();
        }
    }
    ```
