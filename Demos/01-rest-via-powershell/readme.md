# Obtain tokens and connect with the Microsoft Graph using REST

This lab will walk you through connecting to the v2.0 endpoints to authorize the application, obtain a token, and connect with the Microsoft Graph.

## Register the application

1. Visit the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) to register the application.

- Once the application is created, an Application Id is provided on the screen. **Copy this ID**, you will use it as the Client ID.
- Add a new secret by clicking the **Generate new password** button and copy the secret to use later as the Client Secret.
- Click the **Add Platform** button. A popup is presented, choose **Web Application**.
- Change the Redirect URL to **http://localhost:8089**.
- Click **Save** to save all changes.

1. Start Visual Studio 2017 and create a new `ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)`.

Choose **MVC**

![](../../Images/01b.png)

Copy the URL of the MVC app for use in the following script.

Start the debugger.

**Open** a new PowerShell ISE window. **Copy** the following code and **paste** in the script pane. Replace **[YOUR WEB APP URL]** (in the 3rd to last line) with the URL of the web application you created in the last step.

This script will first create an URL to the authorize endpoint, providing the client ID, permission scopes, and redirect URL. If we attempted to use Invoke-RestMethod to this endpoint, the result would be the HTML content of the resulting login screen. We need to actually log in and authorize the application, so we will copy the URL to a browser.

**Run** the PowerShell script. You are prompted to enter a username and password. The username is the Application ID generated when you registered the application, and the password is the secret that was generated.

![](../../Images/02.png)

**Copy** the resulting URL.

![](../../Images/03.png)

**Paste** the URL to a browser window. You are prompted to sign in.

![](../../Images/04.png)

After you sign in an authorize the application, the browser is redirected to the MVC app you have running, the URL contains the code needed.

**Copy** the code value from the querystring in the browser's URL bar, up to the trailing &session_state querystring value.

![](../../Images/05.png)

**Paste** the code value into the PowerShell window.

![](../../Images/06.png)

The result is a successful call to the Microsoft Graph, getting the profile of the currently signed-in user.

![](../../Images/07.png)

The output includes 3 tokens: an id token, an access token, and a refresh token. These tokens are JWT tokens that, as of the time of this writing, can be decoded and their contents inspected.

> **Note:** These tokens are currently not encrypted but that is subject to change.

**Copy** the access_token value in the output.

Open a browser to https://jwt.calebb.net and paste the encoded token to inspect its contents.
