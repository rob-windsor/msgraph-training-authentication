# Dynamic permissions with the v2.0 endpoint and Microsoft Graph

This lab will walk you through creating a web application that connects with Microsoft Graph using OpenID Connect and requests additional permissions.

## Register the application

You can reuse the same application registration from the previous lab, [Connecting with Microsoft Graph using OpenID Connect](#openidconnect). If you have already completed the app registration, move to the next section.

Visit the [Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) to register the application.

- Once the application is created, an Application Id is provided on the screen. **Copy this ID**, you will use it as the Client ID.
- Add a new secret by clicking the **Generate new password** button and copy the secret to use later as the Client Secret.
- Click the **Add Platform** button. A popup is presented, choose **Web Application**.
- Change the Redirect URL to **https://localhost:44326/**.
- Click **Save** to save all changes.

From your shell or command line:

````shell
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-dotnet-webapp-openidconnect-v2.git
````

Open the solution using Visual Studio 2017. Restore the missing NuGet packages and reload the solution.

**Edit** the `web.config` file with your app's coordinates. Find the appSettings key `ida:ClientId` and provide the Application ID from your app registration. Find the appSettings key `ida:ClientSecret` and provide the value from the secret generated in the previous step.

## Inspect the code sample

Open the `App_Start/Startup.Auth.cs` file. This is where authentication begins using the OWIN middleware.

Verify that the `Scope` variable in your code is equal to "openid email profile offline_access Mail.Read", if not, please change it.

````csharp
app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(
    new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationOptions
    {
        // The `Authority` represents the v2.0 endpoint - https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/v2.0
        // The `Scope` describes the initial permissions that your app will need.  See https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-v2-scopes/                    
        ClientId = clientId,
        Authority = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, aadInstance, "common", "/v2.0"),
        RedirectUri = redirectUri,                    
        Scope = "openid email profile offline_access Mail.Read",
        PostLogoutRedirectUri = redirectUri,
        TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
        {
            ValidateIssuer = false,
            // In a real application you would use IssuerValidator for additional checks, like making sure the user's organization has signed up for your app.
            //     IssuerValidator = (issuer, token, tvp) =>
            //     {
            //        //if(MyCustomTenantValidation(issuer)) 
            //        return issuer;
            //        //else
            //        //    throw new SecurityTokenInvalidIssuerException("Invalid issuer");
            //    },
        },
````

When an authorization code is received, the code is redeemed for an access token and a refresh token, which are stored in cache.

````csharp
Notifications = new OpenIdConnectAuthenticationNotifications
{
    // If there is a code in the OpenID Connect response, redeem it for an access token and refresh token, and store those away.
    AuthorizationCodeReceived = async (context) =>
    {
        var code = context.Code;
        string signedInUserID = context.AuthenticationTicket.Identity.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
        TokenCache userTokenCache = new MSALSessionCache(signedInUserID, 
            context.OwinContext.Environment["System.Web.HttpContextBase"] as HttpContextBase).GetMsalCacheInstance();                            
        ConfidentialClientApplication cca =
            new ConfidentialClientApplication(clientId, redirectUri, new ClientCredential(appKey), userTokenCache,null);
        string[] scopes = { "Mail.Read" };
        try
        {
            AuthenticationResult result = await cca.AcquireTokenByAuthorizationCodeAsync(code, scopes);
        }
        catch (Exception eee)
        {
                                
        }
    },
    AuthenticationFailed = (notification) =>
    {
        notification.HandleResponse();
        notification.Response.Redirect("/Error?message=" + notification.Exception.Message);
        return Task.FromResult(0);
    }
}
````

Notice the scope that is requested, `Mail.Read`. The token that is received is only valid for reading emails. If the application attempts to send an email, it would fail because the app has not been granted consent.

Open the `Controllers/HomeController.cs` file and scroll down to the `SendMail` method with no parameters. When an HTTP GET is issued to this page, it will create a token cache and create a new `ConfidentialClientApplication` using the app secret. It then calls `AcquireTokenSilentAsync` using the `Mail.Send` scope. This scope was not requested when the app started, the user will not have already consented.  The MSAL code will look in the cache for a token matching the scope, then attempt using the refresh token, and finally will fail if the user has not consented.

````csharp
[Authorize]
public async Task<ActionResult> SendMail()
{            
    // try to get token silently
    string signedInUserID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
    TokenCache userTokenCache = new MSALSessionCache(signedInUserID, this.HttpContext).GetMsalCacheInstance();            
    ConfidentialClientApplication cca = new ConfidentialClientApplication(clientId, redirectUri,new ClientCredential(appKey), userTokenCache, null);
    if (cca.Users.Count() > 0)
    {
        string[] scopes = { "Mail.Send" };
        try
        {
            AuthenticationResult result = await cca.AcquireTokenSilentAsync(scopes,cca.Users.First());
        }
        catch (MsalUiRequiredException)
        {
            try
            {// when failing, manufacture the URL and assign it
                string authReqUrl = await WebApp.Utils.OAuth2RequestManager.GenerateAuthorizationRequestUrl(scopes, cca, this.HttpContext, Url);
                ViewBag.AuthorizationRequest = authReqUrl;
            }
            catch (Exception ee)
            {

            }
        }
    }
    else
    {

    }
    return View();
}
````

Open the `utils/OAuth2CodeRedeemerMiddleware.cs` file and scroll down to the `GenerateAuthorizationRequestUrl` method. This method will generate the request to the Authorize endpoint to request additional permissions.

````csharp
public static async Task<string> GenerateAuthorizationRequestUrl(string[] scopes, ConfidentialClientApplication cca, HttpContextBase httpcontext, UrlHelper url)
{
    string signedInUserID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst(System.IdentityModel.Claims.ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier).Value;
    string preferredUsername = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("preferred_username").Value;
    Uri oauthCodeProcessingPath = new Uri(httpcontext.Request.Url.GetLeftPart(UriPartial.Authority).ToString());
    string state = GenerateState(httpcontext.Request.Url.ToString(), httpcontext, url, scopes);
    string tenantID = ClaimsPrincipal.Current.FindFirst("http://schemas.microsoft.com/identity/claims/tenantid").Value;
    string domain_hint = (tenantID == "9188040d-6c67-4c5b-b112-36a304b66dad") ? "consumers" : "organizations";
    Uri authzMessageUri =
        await cca.GetAuthorizationRequestUrlAsync(
            scopes,
        oauthCodeProcessingPath.ToString(),
        preferredUsername, 
        state == null ? null : "&state=" + state + "&domain_hint=" + domain_hint,
        null,
        // TODo change
        cca.Authority
        );
    return authzMessageUri.ToString();

}

## Run the application

Run the application.

![](../../Images/13.png)

Clicking the About link or clicking the sign in link in the top right will prompt you to sign in.

![](../../Images/14.png)

After signing in, if you have not already granted consent, the user is prompted for consent.

- Read your mail
- Sign in as you
- Access your data anytime
- View your basic profile

![](../../Images/15.png)

After consenting, click the **About** link. Information about the user is displayed from their current set of claims in the OpenID Connect flow.

![](../../Images/16.png)

Since the user is now logged in, the Read Mail link is now visible. Click the **Read Mail** link. You can now read email messages from your inbox.

The app was consented the ability to read mail, but was not consented to send an email on the user's behalf. The MSAL code attempts a call to `AcquireTokenSilentAsync`, which fails because the user did not consent. The application catches the exception and the code builds a URL to the authorize endpoint to request the Mail.Send permission. The link looks similar to:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?scope=Mail.Send+offline_access+openid+profile&response_type=code&client_id=0777388d-640c-4bc3-9053-671d6a8300c4&redirect_uri=https:%2F%2Flocalhost:44326%2F&login_hint=AdeleV%40msgraphdemo.onmicrosoft.com&prompt=select_account&domain_hint=organizations

![](../../Images/17.png)

Click on the link, and the user is now prompted to consent. The permissions include "Send mail as you". 

![](../../Images/18.png)

After clicking **Accept**, the user is redirected back to the application and the app can now send an email on the user's behalf.
